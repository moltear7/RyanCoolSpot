        Ryan Kreitzer is a currently practicing sculpture artist in Cleveland Ohio. With a love of fantasy settings and glass art Kreitzer 
    seeks to create artwork that inspires the viewer to develop a love of the fantasy and sci-fi genres.

        *************
        <br>
        <br>
        
         I use a combination of glasswork and a DIY aesthetic to create objects that mimic toys and set pieces from fantasy roleplaying games. These objects exist as props within the “theater of the mind” created when playing this type of game. The specific objects are more than just set pieces, they become catalysts for life changing and world shaping events. They become integral assets to the worlds they exist in and help give those settings narrative depth. “Asset” is defined as a “useful or valuable thing, person, or quality.” I am using the game design term of “asset” meaning anything that would be used to create a video game. This could be characters, maps, sounds, UI elements, text pop ups or menu screens; the list goes on and on. 

Many works feel specific but don't generate quite enough information to complete a full narrative. These pieces act as symbols that the viewer doesn’t fully understand, forcing them to project their own narrative, and to imagine what kind of world these pieces come from. Once a piece is given a placement in a setting it ceases to be of our world and exists from the realm of fantasy.

By contrasting the craftsmanship and elegance of glass with the ad hoc nature of DIY, my work highlights the dual nature of the original fantasy roleplaying set pieces. The glass represents something beautiful and almost unattainable, the virtues and longing for fantasy and adventure. The plaster, cardboard and less refined materials represent the human experience, as we attempt to mimic and recreate these fantasies but the cracks and missteps always show through. The temporary nature of these artworks remind us that these fantasies, as well as the games we play, are incredibly fleeting. The narrative itself only exists while the game is being played and our players are engaged. 

By plucking these assets from their fantasized origins and placing them in an environment together, the viewer is tempted and encouraged to study and investigate them. Now the viewer may consider what people or creatures would use or create those objects, and begin to curate a love for fantasy as I have.
